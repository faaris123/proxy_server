# proxy_server
I implemented an HTTP proxy server that handles HTTP GET requests. I provided functionality through the use of HTTP response headers, added support for HTTP error codes, and passed the request to an HTTP file server. The proxy server will wait for the response from the file server, and then forward the response to the client. I also implemented a Priority Queue for the jobs sent to the proxy server This proxy server will implement functionality that will allow the client to query it for job status and order in the priority queue.
